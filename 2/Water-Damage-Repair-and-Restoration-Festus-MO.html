<p>Since common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or moisture direct exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
