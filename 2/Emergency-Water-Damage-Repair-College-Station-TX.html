<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal visible signs of wetness, leaking water, or signs of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels may sag or crumble under the weight of water that fills the naturally permeable gypsum material. Other times, you might notice small signs like coffee-colored discolorations that may broaden in time.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

<p>The kind of water damage plays an aspect into how much you'll spend for water damage repairs.

Projects like hardwood floor replacement are much more expensive with expenses in excess of $4,000. More costly materials will show a greater price tag.
