<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

<h3>Smoke Damage Removal in Vandalia</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold professionals generally advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section.
