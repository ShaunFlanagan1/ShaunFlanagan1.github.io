The only way to secure your home or business from extensive destruction is to put your trust in a team committed to responding immediately to emergencies and catastrophes that affect the communities we serve. Our SERVPRO of Norristown IICRC-certified service technicians have years of combined experience in the restoration market, and we take excellent pride in the expanded stock of advanced innovation and devices.</p>
<p>Negative air makers, geared up with HEPA (high performance particle air filters") must be utilized to get rid of bacteria and other impurities from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage should be extracted with self-contained vacuum equipment with proper waste holding tanks which should be dealt with appropriately. Difficult surface areas that are impacted must be cleaned up and sanitized. Soft structural materials such as carpeting, rug, plaster wallboard should be removed and appropriately disposed of. Any material that takes in substantial quantities of moisture and can not be effectively cleaned up must be gotten rid of. When contaminated materials have been eliminated, a 2nd application of sanitizers need to be applied to all work surfaces.</p>

<p>The equipment we utilize is capable of running for days without being switched off (it will not get too hot), and unless we advise you otherwise, it is best to leave it on and running at all times until the task is finished. Our service specialist will look at the devices and task progress every day, adjusting and moving equipment as needed. If you hear or smell anything which appears to not be abnormal, please unplug the devices in question and call us instantly at (616) 842-9800. If equipment is running in a room that you need to use (to have dinner, watch a motion picture, or even to sleep), let us know and we can make accommodations, but also remember the more the devices is turned off, the more days it may require to be in location.</p>
<p>Mold examination is more than just looking around your home. We really take air samples to evaluate moisture levels both inside and beyond your residential or commercial property to find obvious signs of water damage, leakages, damaged pipelines, or fractures in brickwork. The laboratories take about 3-4 days to test the samples and supply a complete report of findings. Once we have the levels of toxic molds, we can begin our mold remediation process to get the mold out of your property as soon as possible. Call to arrange your mold inspection today if you're ready to get your mold under control.</p>
<p>The key is to carry out a detailed wetness management strategy when it comes to mold.
