<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all affected surface areas begins next. Antifungal and antimicrobial cleansers are utilized on any difficult surfaces to remove the mold from the surface. If anything can be gotten rid of, such as furniture, clothes, or toys, these are typically brought offsite for cleaning to ensure all mold spores are gotten rid of, generally including deep cleaning with an antifungal or antimicrobial  cleanser.</p>

Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at eliminating mold than a mild cleaning agent and a wet cloth, so we advise the least hazardous choice.</p>
<p>Utilizing the chemical dry cleaning sponge, clean the walls gradually and carefully. Whenever the sponge ends up being saturated with soot or smoke, wash and let it dry a bit prior to you continue. Repeat the process up until the majority of the soot is removed.
