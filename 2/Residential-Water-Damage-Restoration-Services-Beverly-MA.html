These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it passes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor eliminated. This process goes on for days.
