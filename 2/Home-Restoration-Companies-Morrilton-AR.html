<p>Fire is the result of a chain reaction between the oxygen that exists in the atmosphere and a source of flammable fuel. When this flammable fuel - drywall, furniture, or carpet - has actually been warmed to its unique ignition temperature level, the fuel will catch fire and unpredictable gases will be released in the kind of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can trigger long lasting damage and needs to be handled by knowledgeable professionals, heat is the most noticeable, and destructive, product of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - suggesting that as a fire enters into contact with additional fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>
