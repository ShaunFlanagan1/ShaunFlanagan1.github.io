<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were really delighted that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much done in one day!  Someone has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to do the job correctly.
