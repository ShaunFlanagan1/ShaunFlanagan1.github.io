Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired rather than being completely replaced. If there is minor damage then the majority of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard might require fixing.

Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
