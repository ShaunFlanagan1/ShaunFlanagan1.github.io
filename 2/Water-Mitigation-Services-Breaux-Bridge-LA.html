<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he learnt how much water costs I was paying because the leakage started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & discovered of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Really polite and easy-going person.</p>
