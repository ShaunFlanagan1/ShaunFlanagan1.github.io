<p>Open doors and windows to get rid of wetness and odors if the weather permits. If the outside humidity becomes higher than inside, close things up; similarly, close up your house overnight if temperature levels drop and wet air might otherwise be drawn inside your home.

<p>As wetness is released in the air, nature always tries to reach equilibrium. Determining the humidity is very important in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The humidity always occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature the air requires to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to accomplish an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas type. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid kind if the air were to be cooled even more.

<p>Prior to you clean the house, you should wear appropriate security. Smoke, particles and soot can be hazardous to breathe in, so use a respirator if there is considerable soot in the damaged area. Wear long pants and sleeves to secure your skin. You must also wear gloves and eye protection. Because you will be freeing soot as you clean, it is very important to put down floor defense and eliminate any furnishings or family things that are not damaged. You can probably get away with just covering furnishings with plastic or sheets if the damaged area is small. But if you're cleaning an entire room, it's a good idea to eliminate those clean items and even seal other rooms that are intact. Bear in mind the shoes you're using so you don't track soot stains into other rooms.<p>

For many years, we have actually used hydroxyl units increasingly more on our fire and smoke jobs. These systems can be used while work is being finished with no damage to technicians or locals. We set these units up on the first day and enable them to run for the entire job. Often, the unit will be set closest to the reason for the fire to be most effective.<p>
