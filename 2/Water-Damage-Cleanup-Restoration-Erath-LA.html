Drywall and other types of wall products usually don't dry extremely well, so if your walls are soaked, it's usually best to rip them out to avoid mold, particularly if they aren't totally dry within 2 days. Like bleach, ammonia will kill mold on tough non-porous surface areas such as countertops, glass or tiles but it is inefficient at killing mold growing in permeable material such as wood or drywall.<p>
<p>Mold found in residential houses can lead to respiratory issues, long-lasting disease, and even death. Though these conditions are uncommon, it is not a risk worth taking.
