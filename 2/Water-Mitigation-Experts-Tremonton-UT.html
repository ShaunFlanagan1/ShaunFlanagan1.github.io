<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals believe that due to the fact that smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this implies that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a wide area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
