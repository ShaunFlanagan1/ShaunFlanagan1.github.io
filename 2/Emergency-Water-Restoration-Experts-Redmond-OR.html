<p>Mold likes to grow in your house's attic and crawl spaces, but what brought the mold in the very first location? The brief answer: darkness and the existence of wetness in the environment. Stone floors require less time to replace than water damaged hardwood floorings. A complete floor replacement can be expected to be completed in four to ten days. Water damaged walls often peel and may need both repair and repainting; the latter service needs a number of hours.<p>
