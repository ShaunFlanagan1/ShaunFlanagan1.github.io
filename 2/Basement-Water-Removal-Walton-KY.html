After the standing water has actually been gotten rid of and materials that could position a drying or structural risk have actually been eliminated, the drying process will begin.

If walls have been affected, it may be necessary to get rid of baseboards or drill holes so that they dry correctly. An area of the carpet might also need to be raised so that the carpet and the pad will dry.

<p>Getting it wet can turn into a major headache since the plaster drywall is soluble and porous in water. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get wet and simply begins to sag prior to drying, repairing it may just need pressing it back into location, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
