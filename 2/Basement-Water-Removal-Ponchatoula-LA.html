<p>Cleanup: Throughout the cleaning and restoration phase of the job, your trained cleanup team will utilize the suitable mix of cleaning representatives, air cleaning devices, and deodorizers. Using chem-sponges is necessary in this stage. When it comes into contact with them, a chem-sponge gathers soot and particles. It also prevents spotting on surface areas and walls.

There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air.
