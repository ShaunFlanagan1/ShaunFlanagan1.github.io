The kind of wood flooring you may have determines and limits the type of repair work that need to happen. Solid hardwood flooring permits a broader variety of alternatives to repair the problem. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area. This type of flooring can also have replacements for specific planks. The best way to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to replace the afflicted boards and then refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
