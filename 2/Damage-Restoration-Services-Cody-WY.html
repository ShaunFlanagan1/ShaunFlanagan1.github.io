<p>Many highly contagious diseases are connected to water damage including skin infections, hepatitis A, salmonella, eye infections, breathing infections, and Weil's disease, as well as blood, kidney, and liver problems. Some of the mold on the surface area may be eliminated but the roots of the mold are left intact meaning the mold soon returns, leaving you in a cycle of repeated whitening. Possibly this is why some individuals think that spraying bleach on mold does not impact it however instead simply bleaches its color so you can no longer see it.<p>
<p>A bleach option also works to eliminate mold. Mix one cup of bleach in a gallon of water, use to the surface area and do not wash.

Refrigerators, water heaters, cleaning machines and dishwaters are all have numerous parts that are vulnerable to deterioration, so keep a cautious watch on older models. The two greatest perpetrators for water damage in homes are washing machines and warm water tanks.<p>
