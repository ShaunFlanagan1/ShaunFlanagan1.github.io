<p>Due to the fact that typical building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or moisture direct exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
