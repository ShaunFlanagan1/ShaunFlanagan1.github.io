<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>

<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were really happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to get the job done properly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
