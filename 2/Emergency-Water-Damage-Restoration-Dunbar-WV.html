<p>As soon as standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) remove the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level as well, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying job back days.

The best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all till you can deal with the damage. Below are a couple of examples of corrosion caused by a water spill.</p>
