<h3>The Role Of Professionals In Smoke Damage Cleanup in Jessup</h3>
<p>Numerous molds prosper at typical indoor temperatures; few if any molds have the ability to grow below 40 F or above 100 F. Outside this range molds might stay inactive or dormant; they may begin to grow once again when the temperature is more favorable. Temperatures well above 100 F will kill mold and mold spores, but the exact temperature required to kill specific species is not well developed.<p>
