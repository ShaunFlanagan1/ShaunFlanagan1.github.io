<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely damaging. As soon as InstaScope was produced, we engaged a group of scientists at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a globally recognized specialist on the biological aspects of air pollution, this team was assigned to verify and test the brand-new technology. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we had the ability to produce a new mold-assessment system for commercial customers that, unlike any other method or device, can provide clinically precise, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so quickly. So when you consider all the threats of mold, InstaScope is an essential tool to help guarantee the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>
<p>Since common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
