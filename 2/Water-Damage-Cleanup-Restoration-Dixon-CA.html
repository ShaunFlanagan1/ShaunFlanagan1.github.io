<p>Deterioration is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the gradual and sluggish deterioration of materials (generally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration happens when you combine electrical energy, water, metal and oxygen, producing iron oxide (or what is more typically called rust). There is no trusted timetable for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal parts usually start wearing away instantly after the spill, but in some cases your Mac can function usually for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of a problem. How quick the rust process takes depends upon a lots of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and how long the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can address the damage. Below are a few examples of rust triggered by a water spill.</p>
