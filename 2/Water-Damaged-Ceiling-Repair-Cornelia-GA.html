<p>As moisture is launched in the air, nature constantly tries to reach equilibrium. Determining the humidity is important in drying due to the fact that when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point constantly takes place at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature the air requires to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas form. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid form if the air were to be cooled even more.

How quickly the corrosion process takes depends on a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and for how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can address the damage. Below are a few examples of corrosion triggered by a water spill.</p>
