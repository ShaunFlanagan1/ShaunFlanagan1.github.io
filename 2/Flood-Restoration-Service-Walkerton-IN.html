Using bleach on noticeable mold development is NOT suggested by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Specialist Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can impact individuals with chemical sensitivities specifically if utilized in areas that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at eliminating mold than a mild detergent and a moist cloth, so we suggest the least hazardous alternative.</p>
