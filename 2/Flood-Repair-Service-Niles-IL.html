<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier because it is self-adhesive, numerous expert drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I prefer paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly convenient. Using paper tape needs some practice and little skill, however it's well worth learning. Once the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the technician will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the area.
