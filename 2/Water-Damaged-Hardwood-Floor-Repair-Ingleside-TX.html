The Florida Department of Health does not suggest mold testing or tasting to see if you have a mold issue, or to see what sort of mold may be growing. Testing for mold in the air can be expensive and, if done, should only be done by experienced professionals. Investigate a mold problem; don't test</p>
<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one jet stream. The rotor brings the damp desiccant to the reactivation air stream to heat it up.

This process takes in moisture without ice build-up and is not restricted by low temperatures. Desiccants can quickly run listed below freezing temperature levels.</p>

After a mold spore lands on a food source that is warm and damp, it starts to colonize and sprout within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots begin to grow into the food source and mycotoxins or toxic gasses are released as the fungis spreads. Mold in your house can be incredibly unsafe and cause a range of health concerns. If the mold in your home is not gotten rid of properly it can continue to grow, making reliable mold remediation more hard and costly.<p>
