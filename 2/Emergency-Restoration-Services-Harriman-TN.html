<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>A pipeline burst in my crawlspace, causing significant water build-up.

Colby returned the next day and set up brand-new insulation in the location. They offered exceptional, effective, and professional service as well as being enjoyable and friendly to work with. I completely recommend Affordable Restoration LLC and will call them once again must the need develop.</p>
