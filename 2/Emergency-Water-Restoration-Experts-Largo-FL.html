<p>Mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to 5 lemons and pour over affected location. Let it sit for five minutes, and then wipe it away with a damp towel. Similar to a few of the above techniques, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little additional heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
