<h3>Why You Should Hire Mount Sinai Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>

Water mitigation has to do with much more than simply cleaning a home and drying. There are numerous other aspects to think about, like decontamination and treating permeable products (e.g. carpet or drywall) that can hold water. If left moist or without treatment, bacteria can possibly flourish and cause future issues.<p>
<p>Likewise, given that bleach is primarily water, on porous surfaces, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is easily taken in by the product. So, while you may have rubbed out or tarnished the surface mold to the point that you can't see it, you've in fact offered a lot of water to regrow and potentially spread the mold beneath the surface. If there is a great deal of mold growth, speak with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ". Printable variations of these and other guidance files are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold website If the musty product is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement might be required.<p>
