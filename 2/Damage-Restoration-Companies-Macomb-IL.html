Ceiling drywall panels may droop or collapse under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable plaster material. Other times, you may notice little signs like coffee-colored spots that might broaden gradually.</p>
<p>The most crucial aspect of remedying drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew happen most regularly when wet drywall sits with insufficient ventilation.
