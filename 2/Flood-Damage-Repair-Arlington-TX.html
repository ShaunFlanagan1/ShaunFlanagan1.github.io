<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one jet stream. The rotor brings the moist desiccant to the reactivation jet stream to heat it up.
