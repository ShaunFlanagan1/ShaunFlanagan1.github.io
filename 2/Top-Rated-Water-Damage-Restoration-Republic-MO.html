<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and pour over afflicted area. Let it sit for five minutes, and after that clean it away with a damp towel. Similar to a few of the above methods, you can utilize a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working all right. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little extra heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's utilized on as it is a harsh, corrosive chemical.

For these reasons try to prevent utilizing bleach and if you need to use it, just utilize it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
