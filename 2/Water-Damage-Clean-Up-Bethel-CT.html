Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
