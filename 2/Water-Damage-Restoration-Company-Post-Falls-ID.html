<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of residential or commercial property damage that a family or business can experience. Once MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other elements.

This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this corrosion procedure is not stopped, you will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight.</p>
