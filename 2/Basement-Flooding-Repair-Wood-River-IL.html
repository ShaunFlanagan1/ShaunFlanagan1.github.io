Try to find noticeable mold development (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or leathery and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Try to find signs of moisture or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water spots, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>As discussed, sometimes ceilings, walls, or floor covering have to be torn out, baseboards might be removed, or holes might be drilled into walls to ensure proper drying.
