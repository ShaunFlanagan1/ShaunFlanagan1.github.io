<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repair work. By lowering the density here, it's easier to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it's important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is completed, this helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
