However contrary to the popular view, it isn't. Bleach is a strong chemical which can harm your health. Also, it does not get rid of the mold. It only changes its color from black to grey or white.

<h3>Facts About House Fire Damage You Need To Be Aware Of in Oceanside</h3>
<p>These are typically great signs of mold, possibly unsafe and absolutely something you wish to remove. The taxonomic name for the greenish-black mold that shows up on ceiling, carpet, and wallpaper tiles is Stachybotrys Chartarum or Black Mold.
