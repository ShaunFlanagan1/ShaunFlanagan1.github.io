<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or organisation is one of the most disastrous things that can happen to a person or a household. When your home is damaged by water, you wish to clean it rapidly and ensure it doesn't take place once again. After all, your home is your safe house, you don't want it infected by toxins, mold, and bacteria from flood water.

Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
