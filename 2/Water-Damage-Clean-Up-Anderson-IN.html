<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or organisation is one of the most disastrous things that can happen to a person or a household.

Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
