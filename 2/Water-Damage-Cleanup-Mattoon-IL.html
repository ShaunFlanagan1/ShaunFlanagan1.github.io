Did you understand that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Lots of people think that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion takes place, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, harming a much broader location than the fire itself.
