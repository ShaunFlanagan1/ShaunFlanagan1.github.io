Part of our tracking procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any changes if you have questions on this.</p>
