This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this deterioration process is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely expensive paperweight.</p>
