<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air up until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground.

Mold works the same method, so if the location the spores land is excellent and wet, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
