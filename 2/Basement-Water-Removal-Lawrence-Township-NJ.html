<p>Find out how to remove black mold safely and efficiently. Make sure to don adequate protective equipment if you choose to manage the mold removal yourself. The CDC suggests that you use long pants and a long-sleeve t-shirt, protective gloves and eyeglasses, waterproof boots, and a mask ranked at least N-95 or more to protect your nose and mouth. Keep in mind that while these masks safeguard you from little particles like mold, they are not adequate if you are coming across any sort of gases, chemical vapors, asbestos or lead.</p>
<p>Since typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
