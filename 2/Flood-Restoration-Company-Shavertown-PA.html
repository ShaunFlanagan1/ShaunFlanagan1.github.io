The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

Contribute to that a climate like Pennsylvania's, where the average annual rains is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much greater.</p>
