<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or problems with excess moisture is at danger of mold growth. Use a respirator or a facemask ranked for black mold spore security, and cover legs, arms and hands to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to eliminate noticeable mold. If the musty area is dry, gently spray with water, as this will reduce the incidence of air-borne mold spores during cleaning. Next, utilize commercial black mold removal products, which can be found in the majority of hardware or home repair stores, to decontaminate the musty locations, in addition to any adjacent locations. Make sure it won't blemish the material or surface if you use bleach. Location all sponges, devices and other products utilized in cleaning in a heavy duty garbage bag, and if possible, eliminate the bag through a close-by exit instead of the primary house, to prevent dispersing mold spores.</p>
