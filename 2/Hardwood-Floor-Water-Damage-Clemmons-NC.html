For long-lasting issues, like mold caused by attic condensation, the mold may have started growing a very long time earlier. And if you find mold and mildew problems, you need to be very careful. Some mold is hazardous to people, and all mold is very destructive to the products it infests. For small mold concerns, cut out the product, bag it, and throw it away right away. For serious mold issues, get out of the location, closed down any airflow (to avoid spore contamination) and call an expert. And remember that mold can appear in concealed locations like within walls or under floors, so this evaluation and water damage repair will be continuous.</p>

The worst invasions usually happen in wet crawl spaces, attics, walls where water dripped in from the outdoors, and in basements with bad foundation drain. Stopping leaks, making sure great ventilation in attics, keeping crawl areas dry and routing water away from the foundation are the best defenses against mold.</p>
