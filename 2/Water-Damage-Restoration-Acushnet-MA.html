<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't constantly hassle-free. Using paper tape needs some practice and little skill, however it's well worth discovering. Once the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the service technician will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation procedure is considered to finish.<p>
