<p>Due to the fact that common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or moisture exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
