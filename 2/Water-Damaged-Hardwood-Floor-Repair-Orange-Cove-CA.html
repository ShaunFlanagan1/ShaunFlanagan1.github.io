<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air up until they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same way, so if the place the spores land is damp and good, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Not to complicate the matter, but to include some clearness to the issue of mold, mold spores threaten. They threaten whether dead or alive. So mold removal is various than mold cleaning. Frequently, mold spores can be gotten rid of rather quickly from surface areas. However a stain can remain. A complete mold remediation and stain removal must be carried out to insure a safe, indoor air environment.</p>

This ground-surface water (storm rise) may accumulate to a depth of numerous inches or numerous feet. Far more sophisticated procedures generally are required when structures are partly immersed or stay significantly flooded for weeks</p>
