<h3>Fire Cleaning Services in Strawberry Plains</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, plaster and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a permanent health risk and need to be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
