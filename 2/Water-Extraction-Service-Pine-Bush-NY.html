<p>Any building that has struggled with water damage or issues with excess wetness is at danger of mold growth. Wear a respirator or a facemask rated for black mold spore security, and cover legs, arms and hands to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to eliminate visible mold. If the musty area is dry, gently spray with water, as this will minimize the occurrence of air-borne mold spores during cleaning. Next, utilize commercial black mold removal items, which can be found in the majority of hardware or home repair stores, to decontaminate the moldy locations, in addition to any surrounding areas. Make sure it will not blemish the material or surface if you use bleach. Place all sponges, devices and other products utilized in cleaning in a heavy duty garbage bag, and if possible, remove the bag through a nearby exit rather than the primary house, to prevent dispersing mold spores.</p>
