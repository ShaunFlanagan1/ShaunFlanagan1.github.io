<p>To get wetness out of the iPhone's interior, you need a desiccant. Many people swear by raw rice, recommending owners to put their moist iPad or iPhone in a huge bowl of the stuff (cover it completely) and leave it there for 2 days or two. A: Mold is a tiny fungus that belongs to the natural surroundings and required for our ecosystem.

As soon as the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the technician will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this point, the water remediation process is thought about to finish.<p>

Utilizing a pump sprayer, mist the surfaces with water to control the spread of spores, and roll up the areas. Double-wrap them in. 6-mm plastic and tape them with duct tape for disposal.<p>
