<p>Mold can trigger severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>To get rid of mold in the basement, scrub the walls using a large brush, and remember that permeable surface areas such as ceiling tiles or drywall might need to be removed and changed. If basement carpet has actually become moldy, sweep it (while using a mask) to loosen up the mold and let it dry in the sun if you can move it, or use high-powered fans to eliminate wetness if it's affixed to the floor.</p>

For small mold problems, eliminated the product, bag it, and toss it away right away. For severe mold issues, get out of the area, shut down any airflow (to prevent spore contamination) and call an expert. And remember that mold can appear in hidden areas like inside walls or under floorings, so this evaluation and water damage repair will be continuous.</p>
