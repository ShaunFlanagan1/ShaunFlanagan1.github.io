Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have actually become contaminated with molds.

When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
