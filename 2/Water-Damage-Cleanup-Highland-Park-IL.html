<h3>From Fire Water Restoration to Mold Removal in Highland Park</h3>

To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the service on the surface affected by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush until the mold disappears. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to wash it off. However, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such products absorb water easily.
