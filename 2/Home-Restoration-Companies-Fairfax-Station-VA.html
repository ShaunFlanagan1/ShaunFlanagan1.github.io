Likewise keep in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is completed, this helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
