<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air up until they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same method, so if the place the spores land is good and moist, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
