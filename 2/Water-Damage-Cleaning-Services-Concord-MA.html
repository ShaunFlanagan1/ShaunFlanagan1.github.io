<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are fantastic for drying in hard to reach areas-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are more suitable when drying under carpet and cushioning. Just like axial fans, centrifugal fans move air throughout damp surface areas, vaporizing moisture into the air.

Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach disappears effective at getting rid of mold than a mild cleaning agent and a wet cloth, so we advise the least toxic choice.</p>
