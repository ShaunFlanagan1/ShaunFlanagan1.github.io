<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and pour over affected location. Let it sit for five minutes, and then clean it away with a moist towel.

For ideal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
