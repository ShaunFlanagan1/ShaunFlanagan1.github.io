<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the present rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he discovered just how much water expense I was paying because the leak began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Very courteous and easy-going individual.</p>
