<p>If smoke and fire damage has actually affected your belongings, we will work with you and your insurance provider to identify what can be restored, and what will be an insurance replacement claim. For products that can be restored, we utilize ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged valuables. For this, we used Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is act like a glue which penetrates into porous surface area, avoiding water from leaking back through. Essentially, it makes the location solid once again and secures the surface from future water damage. After you have actually applied the Peel-Stop, allow for an hour of drying time.<p>
