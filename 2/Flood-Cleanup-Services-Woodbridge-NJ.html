<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, but it can occur on its own if a fire is consisted of. If you make a claim with your carrier, it is your duty to pay the deductible. It is traditional for restoration contractors to gather the deductible in advance when work is to start, and we will notify your insurance company in such circumstances. Other times, your deductible may be deducted" from the last insurance check, in which case you would pay the deductible amount at the end of the job. Another possibility is that your insurance carrier take the deductible quantity off of the quantity they owe you for your personal contents.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
