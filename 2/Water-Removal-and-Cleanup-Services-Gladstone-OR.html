<h2>Tips For Effective Water Damage Restoration in Gladstone</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Daily moisture readings must be consisted of in the drying record to include hvac, devices, and air systems. Moisture content levels for wet structural products should be tape-recorded in a moisture content spreadsheet to show the development of drying These tape-recorded wetness content readings will reveal that the building is back to an appropriate series of pre-loss condition. It is very important to understand that air records alone will not prove that a structure is dry. After 24 hr the psychrometric conditions will show if sufficient dehumidification is being utilized or if modifications are needed.</p>
