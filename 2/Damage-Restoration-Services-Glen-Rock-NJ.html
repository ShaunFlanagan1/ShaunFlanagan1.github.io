<p>Any building that has experienced water damage or problems with excess moisture is at danger of mold growth. Use a facemask or a respirator ranked for black mold spore defense, and cover legs, hands and arms to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to remove noticeable mold. If the moldy location is dry, gently spray with water, as this will reduce the incidence of air-borne mold spores during cleaning. Next, utilize commercial black mold removal products, which can be found in the majority of hardware or home repair shops, to sanitize the moldy areas, in addition to any nearby locations. If you use bleach, make certain it won't discolor the product or surface area. Place all sponges, equipment and other materials used in cleaning in a strong garbage bag, and if possible, get rid of the bag through a close-by exit rather than the primary home, to avoid distributing mold spores.</p>
