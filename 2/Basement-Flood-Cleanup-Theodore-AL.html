<p>Mold and mildew are kinds of fungis that rapidly reach emergency wherever wetness exists indoors. This can result from any variety of circumstances such as flooding, water accumulation after a fire, a damaged pipe, or perhaps a malfunctioning HEATING AND COOLING system - all of which can cause difficulty.
