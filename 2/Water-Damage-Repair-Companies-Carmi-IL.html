<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely harmful. As soon as InstaScope was developed, we engaged a group of scientists at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide recognized specialist on the biological aspects of air pollution, this team was appointed to verify and evaluate the brand-new innovation. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to produce a brand-new mold-assessment system for business clients that, unlike any other method or device, can provide scientifically precise, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so immediately. So when you think about all the risks of mold, InstaScope is a crucial tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
