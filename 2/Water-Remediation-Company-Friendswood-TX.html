<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold experts typically recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the service on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush until the mold vanishes.
