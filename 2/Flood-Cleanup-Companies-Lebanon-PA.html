<p>Corrosion is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the slow and gradual wear and tear of materials (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration takes place when you combine electrical power, metal, water and oxygen, producing iron oxide (or what is more typically called rust).

How quickly the deterioration procedure takes depends upon a lots of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and how long the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all until you can resolve the damage. Below are a couple of examples of corrosion triggered by a water spill.</p>
