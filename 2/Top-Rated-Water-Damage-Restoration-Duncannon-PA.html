<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Try to find noticeable mold growth (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or leatherlike and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Try to find indications of wetness or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>Because common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or wetness direct exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
