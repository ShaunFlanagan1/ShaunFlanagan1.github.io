<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying considering that the leak began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the area of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve. Easy-going and very polite individual.</p>
