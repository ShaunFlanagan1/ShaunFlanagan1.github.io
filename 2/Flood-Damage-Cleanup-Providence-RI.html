<p>BRAVO - task well done! Discovered a flood in the house in San Francisco - water had actually been over flowing a second floor sink for 15 hours.

Drying fans were set up, heating pads were placed on hardwood ceilings, walls and floors were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes installed. Exceptional, professional care.
