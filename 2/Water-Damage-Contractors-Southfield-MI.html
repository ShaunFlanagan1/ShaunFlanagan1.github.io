<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and hauled away everything else.  We were very happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot carried out in one day!  Someone has come out each day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and capabilities to do the job appropriately. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>As soon as the home is dry, we will clean the soot from surfaces, such as ceilings, walls, items, and floorings using specific devices. The restoration team will also get rid of biological and chemical contaminants. Eliminating smoke smells is achieved with equipment such as foggers, ozone generators, and hydroxyl generators. Assessing mold development includes more than simply taking a look at what's noticeably growing on the walls or in a corner. Mold can be an unnoticeable intruder, growing behind and around what you initially see. Such devious habits requires inquisitive thinking.<p>
<p>So how do we look after water damage restoration? Naturally, it might vary depending on the degree and type of water damage. We follow a set of standards that guarantees that every base is covered while we repair the damage. RestorePro did an unbelievable task expertly, rapidly, and wonderfully helped us in securing our company. I can not suggest their services with a high enough star score and while I hope not to have to require their services in the future, if the requirement did develop, there is no other company that I would call to help. HIGHY RECOMMEND.<p>
