<p>Get rid of plaster, paneling and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a long-term health danger and should be eliminated if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
