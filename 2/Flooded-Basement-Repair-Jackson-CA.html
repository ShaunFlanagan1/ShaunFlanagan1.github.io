<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, numerous professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always hassle-free. Utilizing paper tape requires some practice and little skill, but it's well worth finding out. When the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the professional will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this moment, the water remediation procedure is thought about to finish.<p>
