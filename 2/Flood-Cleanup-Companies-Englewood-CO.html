<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surfaces begins next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are used on any tough surfaces to remove the mold from the surface. If anything can be gotten rid of, such as furniture, clothes, or toys, these are generally brought offsite for cleaning to ensure all mold spores are gotten rid of, usually including deep cleaning with an antimicrobial or antifungal cleanser.</p>
