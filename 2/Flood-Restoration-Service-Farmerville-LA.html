While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this means that the smoke will spread, harming a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve browsing a wide location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
