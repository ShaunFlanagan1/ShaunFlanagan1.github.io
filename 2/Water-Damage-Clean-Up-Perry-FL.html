<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a hazardous situation for property owners, according to Pipes 2.0's experienced plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It might cause a back-up of sewage in the home, polluted drinking water and absence of sanitation till the system is repaired. When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a private sewage system can not operate properly (common plumbing problems in old homes ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater rely on aerobic (with oxygen) areas to minimize the amounts of chemicals and living organisms (infections, bacteria and protozoa). When the soil is filled or flooded, those harmful products can enter the groundwater and your drinking supply of water.</p>

Any indoor humidity levels 1 above 45 percent might lead 2 to conditions that enable mold colonies to develop.</p>
<p>To prevent mold in the basement, you need to alter the conditions that can cause it to grow. Initially, get rid of moisture by installing a dehumidifier and ensuring the clothes dryer vent exhausts externally, if you use your basement for laundry.
