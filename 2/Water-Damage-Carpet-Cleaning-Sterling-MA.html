<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and carried away everything else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to get the job done properly.
