<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely damaging. Our task isn't done up until your home is completely restored, back to the method it was prior to the accident. This includes replacing the flooring, drywall, baseboards, ceiling, and even repainting. Among our specialties is replacing or restoring hardwood or engineered flooring.

<p>Because the plaster drywall is soluble and porous in water, getting it wet can become a significant headache. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get wet and just starts to droop prior to drying out, repairing it may simply require pushing it back into location, protecting it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

<p>Mold in the basement can be persistent, given the nature of basements - they tend to be much more damp than above-ground levels and usually have poor ventilation and little air circulation, a combination that can cause mold to thrive. And of course, basements can be vulnerable to flooding, due to severe weather condition or undiscovered leakages in the pipelines or sump pump. In addition, when mold establishes, cinder block or concrete walls can be difficult to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. It can be an irreversible health risk and need to be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, duct work and wiring.</p>
