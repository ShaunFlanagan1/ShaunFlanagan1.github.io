To begin attending to a water damaged wall or ceiling in your home, you need to determine the source of the water. It is possible for water to take a trip far from the site of the leak and trigger damage somewhere else, in unanticipated locations.

<p>Get rid of the gadget from the water as quickly as possible, and get rid of the battery right away. Eliminating the battery quickly could make the difference to save your phone. Many phones have a white sign near the battery that will turn red or pink if water has damaged the gadget. You can try to draw the moisture out by submerging the phone in a bowl of rice or other absorbent material overnight. You can also try to dry it out with a vacuum, as long as you don't hold the vacuum too near the device. Often cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has actually not been exposed to water long.</p>
