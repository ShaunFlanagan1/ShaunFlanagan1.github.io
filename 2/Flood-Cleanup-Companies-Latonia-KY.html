<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Water damage can be the starting point for many severe problems that can impact a structure, damage personal property and present major health risks to residents.

Water damaged structures can be the perfect breeding location for mold, while bad indoor ventilation can trigger molds to prosper. Wet building materials and damp indoor air are mold's best friends.</p>
