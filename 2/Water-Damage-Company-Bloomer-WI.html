<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inefficient against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
