<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one air stream. The rotor brings the moist desiccant to the reactivation air stream to heat it up. Desiccant dehumidifiers work when damp incoming air flows over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant. This procedure takes in wetness without ice build-up and is not restricted by low temperature levels. Desiccants can quickly run below freezing temperature levels.</p>
