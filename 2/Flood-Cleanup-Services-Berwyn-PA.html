<p>Fire is the result of a chain reaction in between the oxygen that exists in the atmosphere and a source of flammable fuel. As soon as this flammable fuel - carpet, drywall, or furniture - has actually been heated up to its unique ignition temperature level, the fuel will catch fire and unpredictable gases will be launched in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can cause lasting damage and should be handled by skilled experts, heat is the most obvious, and harmful, product of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - implying that as a fire enters into contact with extra fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>
<p>When it comes to mold, the secret is to execute an extensive moisture management technique. Possible liability and health problems from mold can be significantly reduced by doing it right the very first time.
