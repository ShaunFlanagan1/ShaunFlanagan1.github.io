<p>Lastly, we want to deal with using bleach on mold. Using bleach on visible mold growth is NOT advised by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Expert Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can affect individuals with chemical sensitivities especially if used in locations that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more efficient at eliminating mold than a moderate cleaning agent and a wet cloth, so we suggest the least hazardous option.</p>
