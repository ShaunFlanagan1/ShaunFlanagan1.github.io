<p>Due to the fact that typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or wetness exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
