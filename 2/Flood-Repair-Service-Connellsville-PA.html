Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he discovered how much water expense I was paying because the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve.
