<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient because it is self-adhesive, lots of expert drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't constantly convenient. Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth discovering. As soon as the meters read wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the service technician will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this moment, the water remediation process is considered to complete.<p>
