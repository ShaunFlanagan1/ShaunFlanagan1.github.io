<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of property damage that a household or business can experience. Once MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals instantly begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with an extremely costly paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>
