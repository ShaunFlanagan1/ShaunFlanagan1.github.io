As soon as MacBook water damage has actually happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with an extremely pricey paperweight.</p>
