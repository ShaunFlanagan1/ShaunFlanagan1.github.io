<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air up until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same way, so if the location the spores land is good and wet, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>

If your screen has actually been damaged by water if there are lines or dark spots under the glass, you can inform. It is hard to state whether this damage is going to be permanent or if it will result in other issues, so the best thing to do is turn it off and leave it to dry for as long as possible.<p>
