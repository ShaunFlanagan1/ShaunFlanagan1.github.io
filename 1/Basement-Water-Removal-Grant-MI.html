Experts have labeled Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has impacted stretching suburban homes, starter homes, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike.

Pay unique attention to pipes in basements, garages, the back of cabinets, and other places that might not be getting the exact same amount of heat as other areas in your house. Covering them in a layer of insulation can go a long method in preventing a burst.</p>
