<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of property damage that a household or business can experience. When MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other elements.

This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with a really expensive paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>
