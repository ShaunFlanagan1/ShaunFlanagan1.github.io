<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors.

Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying because the leakage started, he accepted assist me out on a Sunday morning!
