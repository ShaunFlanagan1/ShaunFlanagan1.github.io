<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for each two to three spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it goes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which suggests that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size.

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends discarding materials that haven't been thoroughly cleaned up and dried within 48 hours of water damage. Repair any leaks or underlying issues immediately to help prevent mold development or its return. Mold exists naturally in the air inside and outside of your home.
