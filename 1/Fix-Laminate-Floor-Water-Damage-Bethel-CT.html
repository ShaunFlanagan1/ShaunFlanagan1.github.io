<p>Under the law, it is your right to identify what company will carry out work in your home or service. Some insurance carriers have preferred contractors" that they suggest, who have arrangements with the insurance provider to deal with water losses in a particular manner, and at pre-determined rates. You should be aware that these companies may depend on these referrals from the insurance providers for their company's income. This might produce a conflict of interest.
