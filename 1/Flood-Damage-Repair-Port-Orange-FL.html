<p>Current Evaluation: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the water company informed me if it's addressing the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he discovered just how much water expense I was paying given that the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve. Really courteous and easy-going individual.</p>
