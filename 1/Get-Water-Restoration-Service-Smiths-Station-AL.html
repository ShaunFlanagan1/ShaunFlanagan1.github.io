<p>Smoke damage can wreak havoc in your home.

So get to work, but not without gloves, eye protection, a facemask, and a respirator to keep smoke particles off your skin and out of your lungs.</p>
<p>An excellent way to avoid mold from growing in your house is to lower humidity and condensation. After a rainy Seattle day, check your home for leakages. If water does enter your home, mop it up quickly and dry the location. Likewise, attempt to increase your home's ventilation by opening windows (when it's not raining, of course) or placing fans in your room. And keep your indoor humidity listed below 60%.</p>
