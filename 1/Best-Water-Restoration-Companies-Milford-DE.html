<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, but it can happen by itself if a fire is consisted of.

<p>Due to the fact that common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
