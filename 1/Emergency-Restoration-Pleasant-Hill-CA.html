<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run.

The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
