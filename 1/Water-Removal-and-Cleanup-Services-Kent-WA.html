<p>Flooding can trigger serious damage to an industrial structure. Whether it's caused by heavy rain, overruning waterways, or damaged pipes, the water must be removed and the building's contents must be rapidly dried to avoid structural damage, mold development, and other problems. When there is lots of moisture from a dripping roofing, high humidity, or flood, the mold grows finest. There is no other way to get rid of all molds and mold spores from your home. However you can manage mold growth by keeping your home dry.<p>

Sometimes it is more cost reliable to take longer to dry versus to demolish and repair.<p>
