<p>Examine damaged materials for mold and mildew Mold can start to grow in the ideal conditions in as little as 24 hr. For long-term issues, like mold caused by attic condensation, the mold may have begun growing a long period of time ago. And if you discover mold and mildew issues, you need to be really cautious. Some mold is poisonous to humans, and all mold is really harmful to the products it infests. For small mold problems, cut out the material, bag it, and throw it away instantly. For major mold issues, leave the area, shut down any airflow (to avoid spore contamination) and call an expert. And keep in mind that mold can appear in concealed locations like within walls or under floorings, so this assessment and water damage repair will be continuous.</p>
<p>After you discover how to get rid of mold, focus on preventing it in the future. Controlling wetness is the key to stopping most mold. The worst problems generally take place in moist crawl spaces, attics, walls where water leaked in from the outdoors, and in basements with bad structure drainage. Stopping leaks, ensuring good ventilation in attics, keeping crawl areas dry and routing water far from the structure are the very best defenses against mold.</p>
