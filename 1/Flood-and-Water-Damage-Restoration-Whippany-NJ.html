<p>Unfavorable air makers, geared up with HEPA (high efficiency particle air filters") should be used to eliminate germs and other contaminants from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage must be extracted with self-contained vacuum equipment with proper waste holding tanks which need to be dealt with effectively. Difficult surfaces that are impacted need to be cleaned up and sanitized. Soft structural materials such as carpeting, carpet pads, plaster wallboard must be eliminated and effectively dealt with. Any product that soaks up significant quantities of wetness and can not be sufficiently cleaned up need to be eliminated. When polluted materials have been eliminated, a second application of sanitizers need to be applied to all work surface areas.</p>
