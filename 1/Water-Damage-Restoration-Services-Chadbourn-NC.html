<p>One factor is that bleach can not totally kill mold growing in porous products. The chlorine in bleach can not penetrate into porous surfaces such as drywall or wood.

Move the brush in mindful strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health issue. After scrubbing completely with the brush, clean the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
