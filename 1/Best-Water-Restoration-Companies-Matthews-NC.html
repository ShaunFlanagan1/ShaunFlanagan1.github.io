<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As pointed out, rapid air movement across wet surfaces of assemblies or products is a crucial part of effectively and efficiently drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface vary from moving excess moisture within the products or assemblies. Quick air motion throughout the surface of material ends up being less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface wetness paves the way to lowering moisture content in low evaporation products. The continuous and falling rates of drying products require different requirements for altering conditions.</p>
