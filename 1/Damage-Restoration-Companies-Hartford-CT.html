<p>When standing water is eliminated, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) remove the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any modifications if you have concerns on this.</p>
