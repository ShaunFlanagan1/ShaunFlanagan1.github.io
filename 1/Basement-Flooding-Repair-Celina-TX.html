<p>Class 2 - considerable quantity of evaporation, water, and absorption load. Water invasion where wet, permeable materials (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry unit (CMU), textiles) represent l ~ 5% to ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling surface area in the space; and where materials described as low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floorings, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have taken in very little moisture.</p>

You can purchase tea tree oil online and in health shops; simply make sure that its from melaleuca alternifolia (an Australian tree) which its active ingredients consist of 30 percent terpinen 4-ol and no more than 10 to 15 percent cineole.

Utilizing a pump sprayer, mist the surfaces with water to control the spread of spores, and roll up the areas. Double-wrap them in. 6-mm plastic and tape them with duct tape for disposal.<p>
