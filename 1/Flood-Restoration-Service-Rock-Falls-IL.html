There is no trustworthy timetable for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal components typically start rusting right away after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can function generally for days or weeks without revealing any apparent indication of an issue. How quick the rust process takes depends upon a lots of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and the length of time the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all until you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of corrosion triggered by a water spill.</p>
