<p>Because typical building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or moisture exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
