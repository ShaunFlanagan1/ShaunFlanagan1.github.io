These conditions can assist in determining what devices to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, sensible and latent energy, can be determined by utilize of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly predicts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to several building products and how they respond to each one and provide the best evaporation outcomes. The higher the number, the faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
