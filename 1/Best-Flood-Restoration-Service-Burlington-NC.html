Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the event where drywall does get damp and just starts to sag before drying out, repairing it may simply require pushing it back into place, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
