<p>Due to the fact that common structure materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete).

Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
