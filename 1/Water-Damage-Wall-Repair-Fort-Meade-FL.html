<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same method, so if the place the spores land is excellent and damp, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>To avoid mold and practice appropriate kitchen upkeep, open windows to improve ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning. Wipe water from hard surfaces, and fix leaking faucets as quickly as possible. Always ensure your tableware and serving meals are dry prior to keeping them to keep mold from multiplying in cabinets. Scrub mold from surfaces as quickly as it appears, then make certain to dry the area to prevent it from spreading.</p>
