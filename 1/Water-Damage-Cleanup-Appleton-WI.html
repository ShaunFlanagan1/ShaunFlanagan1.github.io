<p>When your house floods, the water can wreak havoc on the structure of your home, your possessions, and the health of the inside environment. Flood waters contain many impurities and lots of mud. High dollar items can get destroyed at one time, even with simply an inch of water, for instance: carpeting, wallboard, devices, and furniture. A more severe storm or deeper flood may add damage to much more pricey systems, like: ducts, the heater and ac system, roof, private sewage and well systems, energies, and the foundation.</p>
<h3>Why You Should Hire Appleton Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a permanent health risk and must be gotten rid of. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
