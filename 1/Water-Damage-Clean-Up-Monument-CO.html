<h3>Cleaning Fire Damage in Monument</h3>
<p>Whether it's a burst pipe, flood damage, or any other variety of possible causes, water damage needs rapid and reliable water damage mitigation. Water mitigation is about far more than just cleaning a residential or commercial property and drying. There are numerous other elements to consider, like decontamination and dealing with porous products (e.g. carpet or drywall) that can hold water. If left wet or untreated, germs can possibly thrive and trigger future problems.<p>
<p>Also, considering that bleach is primarily water, on porous surface areas, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is quickly soaked up by the product. So, while you might have wiped off or stained the surface area mold to the point that you can't see it, you've in fact supplied lots of water to regrow and potentially spread out the mold underneath the surface area. If there is a lot of mold growth, consult the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's assistance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ". Printable variations of these and other guidance files are readily available on the EPA's Publications on Mold website If the moldy material is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement might be required.<p>
