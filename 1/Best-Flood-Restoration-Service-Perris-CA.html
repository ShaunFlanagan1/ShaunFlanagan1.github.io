However, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product ought to be gotten rid of to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with full sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be removed to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
