<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Often it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might reveal noticeable signs of wetness, leaking water, or indications of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels may sag or fall apart under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous plaster material. Other times, you may observe little indications like coffee-colored spots that might expand in time.</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is a harsh, destructive chemical.

For these factors try to prevent using bleach and if you must utilize it, only utilize it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
