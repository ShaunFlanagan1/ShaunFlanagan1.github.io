<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surfaces begins next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are used on any difficult surfaces to eliminate the mold from the surface. If anything can be eliminated, such as furnishings, clothes, or toys, these are typically brought offsite for cleaning to make certain all mold spores are removed, generally involving deep cleaning with an antimicrobial or antifungal cleanser.</p>
