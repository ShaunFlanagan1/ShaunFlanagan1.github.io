<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold professionals generally advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the solution on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush up until the mold disappears. There's no need to wash it off due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such products take in water quickly. This could aggravate the issue due to the fact that as you know - mold likes wet environments.<p>
