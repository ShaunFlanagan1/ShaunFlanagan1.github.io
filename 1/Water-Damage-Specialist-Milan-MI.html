The normal fans and blowers utilized to dry a structure that has experienced a clean water damage (non-sewage) need to not be used in the early phases of a sewage clean-up project.</p>

<h3>Emergency Fire and Smoke Damage Cleanup in Milan</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be an irreversible health threat and must be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the idea of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
<p>Deodorization: In concerns to deodorization, we use either ozone makers, which can only be utilized when the residential or commercial property is totally vacant for an extended time, or hydroxyl systems. Throughout the years, we have utilized hydroxyl systems a growing number of on our fire and smoke jobs. These systems can be used while work is being completed without any harm to locals or technicians. We set these systems up on day one and permit them to run for the whole job. Frequently, the unit will be set closest to the reason for the fire to be most effective.<p>
