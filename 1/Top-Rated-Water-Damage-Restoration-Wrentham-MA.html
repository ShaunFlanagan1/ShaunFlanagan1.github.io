Once this flammable fuel - carpet, furniture, or drywall - has actually been heated to its unique ignition temperature level, the fuel will ignite and unpredictable gases will be launched in the kind of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can trigger long lasting damage and needs to be dealt with by experienced professionals, heat is the most visible, and damaging, product of this chain reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - meaning that as a fire enters into contact with extra fuel, the response continues and the fire spreads.</p>
