Part of our tracking process consists of examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying task back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any changes if you have concerns on this.</p>
