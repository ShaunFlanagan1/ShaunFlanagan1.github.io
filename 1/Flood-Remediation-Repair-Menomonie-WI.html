<p>Likewise, because bleach is primarily water, on permeable surfaces, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is quickly taken in by the material. So, while you might have rubbed out or discolored the surface area mold to the point that you can't see it, you've in fact offered plenty of water to grow back and possibly spread out the mold underneath the surface area. If there is a great deal of mold development, seek advice from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ". Printable variations of these and other guidance documents are readily available on the EPA's Publications on Mold web page If the moldy material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement may be essential.<p>
