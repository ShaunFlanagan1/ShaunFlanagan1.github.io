<h3>Fire Damage Cleaning Services in North Bend</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repairs. By decreasing the density here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is essential to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the job is completed.<p>
