<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold professionals typically recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the solution on the surface affected by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears. There's no need to wash it off because borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall. Such products take in water quickly.
