<p>Step 5: Restoration - The most significant action in the procedure is restoration. Restoration includes replacing materials like drywall and insulation.

Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more effective at getting rid of mold than a wet cloth and a mild detergent, so we suggest the least poisonous choice.</p>
<p>We will do our best to restore your contents to a pre-loss condition. Some items, when exposed to water for an amount of time, become completely damaged (i.e. they will never be the same).
