<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>

Nevertheless, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product need to be gotten rid of to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
