<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company informed me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, but when he learnt how much water bill I was paying since the leak began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & found of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Extremely courteous and easy-going individual.</p>
