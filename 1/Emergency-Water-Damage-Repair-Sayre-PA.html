<p>Floors or walls, this is a sure indication of mold development if there are dark spots on your ceiling. Musty odors and mildew are typically indications that mold might be growing in your home. Respiratory and allergy symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, difficulty breathing and wheezing are a common indication of mold growth also. Also, high humidity levels such as condensation on glass and metal surface areas are a warning sign of mold.</p>
<p>Fire is the result of a chain reaction between the oxygen that exists in the environment and a source of combustible fuel. Once this flammable fuel - furnishings, carpet, or drywall - has been warmed to its distinct ignition temperature, the fuel will catch fire and volatile gases will be released in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can trigger enduring damage and needs to be handled by knowledgeable professionals, heat is the most obvious, and devastating, item of this chain reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - suggesting that as a fire enters contact with additional fuel, the response continues and the fire spreads.</p>
