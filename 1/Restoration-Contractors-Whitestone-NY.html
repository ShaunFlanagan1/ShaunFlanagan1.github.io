Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying given that the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the area of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve.
