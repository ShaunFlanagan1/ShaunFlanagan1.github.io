Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt just how much water costs I was paying because the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and then even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely courteous individual.</p>
