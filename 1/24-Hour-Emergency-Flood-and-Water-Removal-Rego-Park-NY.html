<p>The most efficient way to avoid mold growth on water damage is to start the drying process quickly. Restoration companies that understand possible mold development problems typically understand how to dry structural products by reducing the indoor humidity, carefully move air and in many cases heat up the afflicted location. This is usually an effective method to dry a structure, leading to reduced product removal and decreased mold growth.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for every two to three spaces, depending upon the size of the room. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it passes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which implies that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can imagine, throughout a number of days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
