<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As pointed out, rapid air motion across damp surface areas of products or assemblies is a vital element of successfully and efficiently drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface differ from moving excess wetness within the materials or assemblies. Quick air movement throughout the surface area of product becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface area moisture gives way to minimizing moisture content in low evaporation products. The continuous and falling rates of drying materials need various requirements for changing conditions.</p>
