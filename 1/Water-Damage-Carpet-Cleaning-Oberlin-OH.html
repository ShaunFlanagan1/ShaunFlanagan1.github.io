<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely harmful. Jake and his men were amazing in helping us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace right away. They came back every day (often twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the method and also were extremely handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>
