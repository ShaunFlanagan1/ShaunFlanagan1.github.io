<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's utilized on as it is a severe, corrosive chemical.

There are much safer options such as borax or vinegar which do not produce dangerous fumes or leave behind toxic residue. For these factors try to avoid utilizing bleach and if you must utilize it, only utilize it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
