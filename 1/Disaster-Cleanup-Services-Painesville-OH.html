<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air up until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the place the spores land is excellent and wet, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Fires can be specifically devastating to your home or company. After the fire trucks leave, your home will likely experience not just fire and smoke damage, but also extensive water damage and flooding from firefighting efforts. SERVPRO Franchise Professionals have specialized fire and water damage restoration training and experience to rapidly clean up and restore your home to pre-fire condition. They also can get rid of the pervasive smoke odor and deep-clean soot from upholstery and carpet.</p>

Water damage spreads quick and can cause mold and other air-borne irritants. And while you might be thinking, Water takes in.

We believe contents need to be gotten rid of for cleaning after fire damage, smoke smell eliminated, and entire structure cleaned from the result of fire. We take pride in restoring residential and industrial structures and individual valuables from fire damage.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for every 2 to 3 spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it passes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell got rid of. This procedure goes on for days. As you can picture, over the course of a number of days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
