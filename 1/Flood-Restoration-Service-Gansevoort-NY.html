Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, but when he learnt how much water expense I was paying considering that the leakage began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & found of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Extremely polite and easy-going person.</p>
