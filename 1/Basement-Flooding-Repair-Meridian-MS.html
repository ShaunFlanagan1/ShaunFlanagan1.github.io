The CDC suggests that you wear long pants and a long-sleeve shirt, protective gloves and eyeglasses, water resistant boots, and a mask ranked a minimum of N-95 or more to secure your nose and mouth. Note that while these masks safeguard you from small particles like mold, they are not sufficient if you are coming across any sort of gases, chemical vapors, asbestos or lead.</p>
<p>Since common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete).

Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
