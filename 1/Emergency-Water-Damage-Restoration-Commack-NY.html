<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens. An automatic shut-off valve is excellent insurance coverage to have in any situation, specifically when the water heater system is located inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your hot water heater is imminent unless repaired rapidly, and the expenses go up the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The offender may have been something as simple as a pressure relief valve requiring replacing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
<p>An insurance plan may or might not cover the costs associated with water damage and the process of water damage restoration. While a typical cause of residential water damage is frequently the failure of a sump pump, lots of property owner's insurance policies do not cover the associated expenses without an addendum which contributes to the regular monthly premium of the policy. Typically the verbiage of this addendum is similar to "Sewer and Drain Pipes Coverage".</p>
