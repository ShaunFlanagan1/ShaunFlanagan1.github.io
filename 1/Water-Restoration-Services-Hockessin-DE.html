<p>In the course of a remediation, we occasionally advise discarding certain kinds of surface areas and things. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all typical items in requirement of disposal. That's all part of the cleanup process, which also consists of vacuuming and sweeping up any dirt or minor particles ignored in the remediation process. An unique HEPA vacuum makes sure that even small particles get collected to reduce the chances of the mold moving elsewhere. This aids in our efforts at containment of the mold. We wish to make two times as sure that mold doesn't discover an escape of the contained work area and into a different part of the structure.</p>

<p>Once standing water is removed, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has absorbed (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature level as well, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying task back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any adjustments.</p>
<p>One of the worst impurities known is the quiet but harmful growth of mold.
