Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
