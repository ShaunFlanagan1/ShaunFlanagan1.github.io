What you may not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Mold is a common perpetrator of damage in much of our houses and businesses here in Central Illinois. When wetness is present, mold spores can spread out quickly.
