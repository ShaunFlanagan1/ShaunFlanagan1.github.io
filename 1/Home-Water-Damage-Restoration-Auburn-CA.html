<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and hauled away everything else.  We were really happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job correctly.
