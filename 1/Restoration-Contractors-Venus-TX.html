<p>Because the gypsum drywall is porous and soluble in water, getting it wet can become a major headache. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get damp and just begins to droop before drying, fixing it may just require pushing it back into location, securing it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
