<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
