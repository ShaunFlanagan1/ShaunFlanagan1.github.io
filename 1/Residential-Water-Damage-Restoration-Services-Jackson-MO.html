Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he discovered how much water bill I was paying because the leak began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the location of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really respectful person.</p>
