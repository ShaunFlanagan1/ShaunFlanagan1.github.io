<p>Because common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or moisture exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
