<p>The Chem-Dry exclusive Hot Carbonating Extraction (HCE) cleaning process provides a much deeper, longer enduring clean for a much healthier home. Based on research studies carried out by independent laboratories of Chem-Dry's HCE (Hot Carbonating Extraction), P.U.R.T. (Animal Urine Removal Treatment), Granite Counter Top Renewal, and Tile, Stone & Grout cleaning processes. Irritants evaluated were dog and feline dander and allergen irritant. Family pet smell results based upon testing with the most common smell sources found in dog and feline urine. Animal urine bacteria results based on Chem-Dry's HCE cleaning procedure and a sanitizer, integrated with P.U.R.T. All germs results include usage of sanitizer. Figures are a typical across several tests.</p>
<p>Lastly, we want to attend to making use of bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on visible mold growth is NOT suggested by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Expert Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can impact individuals with chemical level of sensitivities especially if used in areas that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at getting rid of mold than a damp fabric and a mild cleaning agent, so we advise the least toxic option.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for each two to three spaces, depending on the size of the space. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it passes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and certified to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which means that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the smell removed. This process goes on for days. As you can think of, over the course of a number of days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
