There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process consists of checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any adjustments if you have questions on this.</p>
