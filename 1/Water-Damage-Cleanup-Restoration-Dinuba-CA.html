<p>Recent Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and carried away everything else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to get the job done properly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>

<p>Mold that is growing on basement walls or other surface areas might be scrubbed with one part bleach to eight parts water. Mold is a type of invasive fungi that may grow on surfaces inside your home. It differs in color and type, and is usually discovered in areas that have actually undergone wetness at some time in time, such as restrooms or in areas around leaking pipelines. Before you begin a job like this, give the water damaged location a good clean. This is the textbook primary step in any paint project, consisting of fixing water damage on walls. We recommend using something like a Selleys Sugar Soap with a damp fabric and after that enabling time for the area to dry.<p>
