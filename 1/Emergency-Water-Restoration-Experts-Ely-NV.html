Before mold lies, you might smell an unique moldy fragrance or experience allergy signs due to mold exposure. These odors are especially pungent in areas like the basement. The foul smell resembles the aroma of damp, mildewy laundry. Regrettably, it's not uncommon for homeowners to error mold growth for dirt.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The greatest step in the process is restoration. Restoration includes changing products like drywall and insulation.
