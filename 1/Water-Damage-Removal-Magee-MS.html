<p>Smoke damage is a typical side effect of fire damage, but it can happen on its own if a fire is included. Without proper cleaning, smoke odor stays in clothing, linens, drapes, pillows, clothes and other soft" products for months or longer. Soot and fire residue discolorations frequently can't be removed using readily-available home products.

Likewise, since it's in the air, it's almost impossible to contain. Even after a fire is dispatched, smoke in the air can cause damage. Smoke damage restoration services are typically needed to restore damage left from little indoor fires.</p>
