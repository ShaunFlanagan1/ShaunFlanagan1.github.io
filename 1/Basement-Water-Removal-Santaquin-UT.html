<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Not to complicate the matter, but to add some clarity to the problem of mold, mold spores threaten. They are dangerous whether dead or alive. So mold removal is different than mold cleaning. Frequently, mold spores can be gotten rid of quite easily from surfaces. However a stain can remain. A complete mold remediation and stain removal should be performed to guarantee a safe, indoor air environment.</p>

Coverage for surface water invasion to the house would normally need a separate flood insurance plan.</p>
