Did you know that smoke is in fact made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many people believe that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion occurs, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this indicates that the smoke will spread, harming a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve searching a broad location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
