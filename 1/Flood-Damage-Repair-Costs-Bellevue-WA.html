<p>I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a costs for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he discovered just how much water bill I was paying because the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning!
