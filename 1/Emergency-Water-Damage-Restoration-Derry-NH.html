Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he found out just how much water costs I was paying given that the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & found of the leak for me and then even assisted me shut down my main water valve.
