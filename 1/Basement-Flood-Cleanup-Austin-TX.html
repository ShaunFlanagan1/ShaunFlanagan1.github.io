<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air up until they land someplace. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the same method, so if the location the spores land is damp and excellent, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
