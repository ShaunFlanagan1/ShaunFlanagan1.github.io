<p>Mold in the basement can be relentless, given the nature of basements - they tend to be far more humid than above-ground levels and usually have bad ventilation and little air circulation, a combination that can trigger mold to thrive. And naturally, basements can be vulnerable to flooding, due to extreme weather or undetected leaks in the pipelines or sump pump. In addition, as soon as mold establishes, concrete block or concrete walls can be difficult to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>Mold is a fungi that can be discovered both inside and outdoors. Nobody knows how many species of mold exist but approximates range from 10s of thousands to maybe 3 hundred thousand or more.

Considering that you will be freeing soot as you clean, it is necessary to set floor defense and get rid of any furniture or household objects that are not damaged. You can probably get away with merely covering furniture with plastic or sheets if the damaged location is small. However if you're cleaning an entire space, it's a good idea to remove those clean products and even seal other rooms that are intact. Be mindful of the shoes you're wearing so you don't track soot stains into other rooms.<p>
