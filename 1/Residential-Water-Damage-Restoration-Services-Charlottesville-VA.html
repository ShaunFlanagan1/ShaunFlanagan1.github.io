<p>Mold damage might or might not be covered by your house owner's insurance coverage. It may be covered by insurance coverage when a product currently covered under your property owners insurance breaks mistakenly-- for example, if your plumbing unexpectedly ruptures and water floods your house, the house owners insurance coverage will cover part or all of the expenses for the plumbing repair and any mold remediation expenses necessary as a direct result of the water damage.<p>

If there is a lot of mold growth, seek advice from the U.S. Epa's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ". Printable variations of these and other assistance documents are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the moldy material is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement might be needed.<p>
