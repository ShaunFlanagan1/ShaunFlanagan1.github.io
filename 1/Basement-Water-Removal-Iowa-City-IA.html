<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Measure the height and width of the space you're repairing so that you know just how much new wallboard you need. If you need custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, use your measurements to cut a patch to fit, utilizing an energy knife or drywall saw. Align your new panel with the wall studs and after that protect the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power chauffeur. Use joint tape to cover the seams where each panel meets. Then use joint substance over the tape, using a putty knife. Let the substance dry for the time defined by the manufacturer and after that sand the substance with fine-grit sandpaper until the joints are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
<p>To eliminate mold in the basement, scrub the walls utilizing a big brush, and bear in mind that permeable surfaces such as ceiling tiles or drywall might need to be removed and changed. If basement carpet has ended up being musty, sweep it (while wearing a mask) to loosen up the mold and let it dry in the sun if you can move it, or utilize high-powered fans to eliminate wetness if it's affixed to the floor.</p>
