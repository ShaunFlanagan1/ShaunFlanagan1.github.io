Gotten in touch with Allied, signed work order on line and employees were at the house within 15 minutes. They brought a truck load of devices to alleviate the damage. Drying fans were installed, heating pads were placed on hardwood floorings, walls and ceilings were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes installed. Outstanding, expert care.
