<p>Since typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
