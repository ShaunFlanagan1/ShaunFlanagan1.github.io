<p>Before you clean the house, you need to wear correct defense. Soot, smoke and debris can be hazardous to breathe in, so use a respirator if there is significant soot in the damaged location. Use long sleeves and trousers to protect your skin. You must also use gloves and eye defense. Because you will be freeing soot as you clean, it is essential to put down floor security and remove any furnishings or family items that are not damaged. You can most likely get away with just covering furnishings with plastic or sheets if the damaged area is little. However if you're cleaning a whole room, it's smart to remove those clean items and even seal other rooms that are intact. Be mindful of the shoes you're using so you don't track soot spots into other spaces.<p>
