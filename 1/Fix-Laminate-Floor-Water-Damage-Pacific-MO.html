<h2>Major Drywall Repair Mistakes When Dealing With Water Damage in Pacific</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>To prevent mold and practice sufficient kitchen area upkeep, open windows to enhance ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning. Clean water from difficult surfaces, and repair dripping faucets as soon as possible. Constantly make sure your tableware and serving dishes are dry before saving them to keep mold from proliferating in cabinets. Scrub mold from surfaces as quickly as it appears, then make sure to dry the location to avoid it from spreading.</p>
