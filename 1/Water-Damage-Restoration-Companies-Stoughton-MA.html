<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>When a fire or smoke damage has occurred in a home or company, there is a lot that needs to be dealt with in the aftermath. Knowing what to do and how to do things is essential in properly reducing the damage that has occurred.

We have had the experience handling practically every type of fire and know what is needed to bring things back to normalcy. When addressing a fire and or smoke damage, we follow numerous actions.</p>
<h3>Hardwood Floor Water Damage in Stoughton Massachusetts</h2>
<p>These elements influence the motion of moisture within a material as well as the evaporation rate from the surface area of the material and can significantly affect the overall drying. time for a project. It is important to rapidly manage the moisture in the air and use enough air flow to dry the surface of products to minimize water activity, therefore lowering the potential for microbial development. If the surface areas of hygroscopic materials can be dried and maintained listed below 0.75, microbial development can be rapidly halted, despite the fact that the core of the material may still have elevated wetness content.</p>
<p>When standing water is removed, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has absorbed (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) remove the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any changes if you have questions on this.</p>
