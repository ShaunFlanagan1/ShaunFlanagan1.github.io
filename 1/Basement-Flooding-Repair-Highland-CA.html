<p>HVAC: Heating unit and ac system units can end up being flooded, which can damage their internal electrical systems and douse pilot burner. They can also become muddy, and cleaning them will need expert cleaning. In addition, venting systems can flood and become polluted.

As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with complete sheets.

<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for every single two to three spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it travels through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of several days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
