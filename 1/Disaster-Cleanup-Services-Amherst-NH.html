<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air up until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same way, so if the place the spores land is moist and great, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
<p>In the course of a remediation, we periodically advise disposing of certain kinds of surface areas and items. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all typical products in need of disposal.
