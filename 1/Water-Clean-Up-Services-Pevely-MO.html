<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air till they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same way, so if the location the spores land is excellent and moist, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was easy: It was a best storm"-- a combination that attorneys now allege came from pressure to build quicker, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure products, and little federal government and builder oversight. Add to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the average yearly rains is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much greater.</p>

This is normally an effective method to dry a structure, resulting in reduced product removal and decreased mold growth.</p>
<p>When your house floods, the water can damage the structure of your house, your valuables, and the health of the inside environment. Flood waters contain many impurities and great deals of mud. High dollar items can get destroyed at one time, even with simply an inch of water, for instance: carpets, wallboard, devices, and furnishings. A more serious storm or deeper flood might include damage to much more expensive systems, like: ducts, the heating system and a/c unit, roofing, private sewage and well systems, utilities, and the foundation.</p>
