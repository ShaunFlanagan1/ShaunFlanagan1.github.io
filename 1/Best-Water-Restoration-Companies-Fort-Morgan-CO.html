When MacBook water damage has actually happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other elements. The liquid's salts and minerals right away begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Frequently, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then quit working.

If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with an extremely costly paperweight.</p>
