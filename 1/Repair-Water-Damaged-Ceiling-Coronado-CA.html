<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Water damage, water invasion, developing envelope problems, and construction flaws are a very serious matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding areas are experiencing numerous issues due to dripping doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living centers, homes, condos, townhouses, hotels, industrial structures are particularly susceptible to these concerns as generally the contractor farms out the outside envelope work and wall assembly procedure, therefore leading to costs and corners being cut.</p>
<p>Water damage develops from damaged pipelines, obstructed drains, malfunctioning home appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The proper treatment depends on the nature of the damage.

Even clean water can produce mildew and other bacterial development if overlooked.</p>
