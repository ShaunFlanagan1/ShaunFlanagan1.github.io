<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of residential or commercial property damage that a family or organisation can experience. As soon as MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with a really expensive paperweight if this corrosion process is not stopped.</p>
