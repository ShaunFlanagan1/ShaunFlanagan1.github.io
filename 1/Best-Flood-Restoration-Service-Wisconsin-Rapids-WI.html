<p>Damage triggered by water that has actually been on the ground at some point before entering your home is considered to be water flood damage and is not covered by a standard house owner's insurance plan. Water flood damage can be guaranteed just with a flood insurance policy written by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)-- no other insurance coverage will cover flood damage.

Part of our tracking procedure includes checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any modifications if you have questions on this.</p>
<p>Devices used in mold remediation consists of: wetness meter: measures drying of damaged materials; Humidity gauge: often paired with a thermometer; borescope: Video camera at the end of a flexible snake, illuminating potential mold problems inside walls, ceilings and crawl areas; digital electronic camera: Documents findings throughout assessment; individual protective equipment (PPE): Respirators, gloves, resistant fit, and eye defense; thermographic camera: Infrared thermal-imaging cams recognize secondary wetness sources.</p>
