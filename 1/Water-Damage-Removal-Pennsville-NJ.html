<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Pennsville - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repair work. By minimizing the thickness here, it's simpler to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is very important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges.

When the task is finished, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
