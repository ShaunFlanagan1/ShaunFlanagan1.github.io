<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or business is among the most destructive things that can occur to a person or a household. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor may be fixed instead of being fully replaced. If there is small damage then the majority of the floor can be conserved and a separated floorboard might require repairing.

The sort of wood floor covering you might have identifies and restricts the type of repair work that need to happen.
