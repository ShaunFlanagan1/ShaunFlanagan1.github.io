<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Often it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may show visible signs of wetness, dripping water, or indications of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels may collapse or droop under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous gypsum product. Other times, you may discover small signs like coffee-colored spots that may expand over time.</p>
<p>Since common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or wetness exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
