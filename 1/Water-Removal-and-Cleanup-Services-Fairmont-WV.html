<p>There are three standard steps to the water damage restoration procedure. The primary step is to get rid of all of the water from the affected residential or commercial property. That suggests fixing any pipes problems, repairing any issues that could be causing condensation, or awaiting the floodwaters to decline, depending on the scenarios. After the problem has been fixed, the residential or commercial property then needs to be completely dried out, removing all traces of moisture.</p>
<p>Lastly, we want to attend to the use of bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on visible mold growth is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Specialist Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can affect people with chemical sensitivities especially if utilized in locations that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach disappears efficient at eliminating mold than a moist cloth and a moderate detergent, so we recommend the least poisonous choice.</p>
<p>Dry-Out- After all demolition is complete we will inspect moisture readings once again and establish drying equipment. The drying equipment will consist of dehumidification which will pull moisture out of the air, and start drying your home. EnviroShield will also utilize fans that will help move the air for the dehumidification to work at its best performance. Once the drying equipment is in location it will be required to keep the devices on 24 hours a day till the drying process is ended up. The EnviroShield Manager will be in charge of monitoring the drying process every day till the structure is dried to appropriate levels.</p>
