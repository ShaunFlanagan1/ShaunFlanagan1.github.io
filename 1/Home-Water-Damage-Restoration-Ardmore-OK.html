This consists of if they do both screening and remediation, as that is considered a conflict of interest.

When not possible, the reason needs to be mentioned (e.g. remote locations may not have both).<p>
<p>You might work with a professional to check whether the dark mold you see is black mold. Nevertheless, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says the cost is not worth it because any mold-- black or otherwise-- need to be eliminated from your home.
