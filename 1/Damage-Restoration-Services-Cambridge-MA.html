The best way to avoid mold growth is to remove water leaks or moisture in your house. See our post, How Do I Avoid Mold Development?" for mold prevention ideas.</p>

Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
