Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
