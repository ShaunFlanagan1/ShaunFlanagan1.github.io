<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are great for drying in hard to reach locations-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are more suitable when drying under carpet and cushioning. Just like axial fans, centrifugal fans move air across wet surfaces, vaporizing wetness into the air. With the use of warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, an adequate variety of centrifugal fans are preferred.</p>

Water invasion where damp, porous materials (e.g., carpet, plaster board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry unit (CMU), textiles) represent l ~ 5% to ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling surface area in the space; and where materials referred to as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have actually absorbed minimal wetness.</p>
<p>We utilize advanced digital moisture meters designed to specifically check for appropriate wetness content in numerous types of building products. Some products will take on more water than others, and some products can be more challenging to dry.
