<h3>Fire Damage Clean Up in Rosedale</h3>

Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to wash it off. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials absorb water easily. This might aggravate the issue because as you know - mold enjoys wet environments.<p>
