<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Cleanup: Throughout the cleaning and restoration stage of the project, your experienced cleanup team will utilize the appropriate mix of cleaning agents, air cleaning devices, and deodorizers. The use of chem-sponges is vital in this stage. A chem-sponge collects soot and particles when it enters contact with them. It also avoids streaking on walls and surface areas. Walls and ceilings that need to be cleaned are very first cleaned up with a dry chem-sponge, then with a degreaser and deodorizing agent. These numerous steps are needed to guarantee walls and ceilings are clean and that residual odor has actually been gotten rid of.</p>
