<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Measure the height and width of the area you're fixing so that you understand just how much brand-new wallboard you need. If you need custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, use your measurements to cut a patch to fit, using an utility knife or drywall saw. Align your brand-new panel with the wall studs and after that protect the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power driver. Use joint tape to cover the joints where each panel satisfies. Then apply joint compound over the tape, using a putty knife. Let the substance dry for the time defined by the manufacturer and then sand the substance with fine-grit sandpaper till the seams are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of treating drywall water damage is to prevent extra damage from mold or mildew.

Standard household fans are not efficient in moving an appropriate quantity of air required to dry a room effectively.</p>
