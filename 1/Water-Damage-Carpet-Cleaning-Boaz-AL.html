<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>An insurance policy might or might not cover the costs associated with water damage and the procedure of water damage restoration. While a typical reason for residential water damage is typically the failure of a sump pump, many property owner's insurance plan do not cover the associated expenses without an addendum which contributes to the regular monthly premium of the policy. Often the terminology of this addendum resembles "Sewer and Drain Pipes Coverage".</p>
