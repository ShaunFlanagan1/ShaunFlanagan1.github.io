<p>Flooding can trigger severe damage to an industrial structure. Whether it's triggered by heavy rain, overruning waterways, or damaged pipes, the water needs to be removed and the structure's contents should be rapidly dried to prevent structural damage, mold development, and other problems. When there is lots of moisture from a dripping roofing system, high humidity, or flood, the mold grows best. There is no chance to eliminate all molds and mold spores from your home. But you can manage mold development by keeping your home dry.<p>
