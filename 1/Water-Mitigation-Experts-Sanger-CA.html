<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be exceptionally devastating. We engaged a team of scientists at the University of Colorado when InstaScope was created. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally acknowledged professional on the biological aspects of air pollution, this group was assigned to validate and evaluate the new innovation. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to produce a new mold-assessment system for commercial consumers that, unlike any other method or device, can deliver clinically precise, area-by-area results-- and do so immediately. So when you think about all the risks of mold, InstaScope is an important tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>

If your insulation has actually been affected, we will eliminate the damaged insulation, bag it up, and securely deal with it. We will likewise check vapor barriers (a sheet or coating that prevents water vapor from penetrating walls) and eliminate them if they have been damaged.</p>
