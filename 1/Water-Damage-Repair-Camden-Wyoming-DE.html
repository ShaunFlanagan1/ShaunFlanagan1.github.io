<p>Smoke damage is a typical side effect of fire damage, however it can take place by itself if a fire is included. After the standing water has actually been removed and products that could posture a drying or structural danger have been eliminated, the drying process will start. This typically involves placing fans and a dehumidifier in the location. In some cases, it may also involve setting up plastic sheeting and using heating units so that the water can evaporate. If walls have been impacted, it may be necessary to eliminate baseboards or drill holes so that they dry appropriately. An area of the carpet might also have to be raised so that the pad and the carpet will dry.

<p>Since common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or wetness exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete).

Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
