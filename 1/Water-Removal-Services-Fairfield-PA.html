<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Fairfield - Restore Your Home and Your Life After Fire</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a permanent health hazard and must be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls.
