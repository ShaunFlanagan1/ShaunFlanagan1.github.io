Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
