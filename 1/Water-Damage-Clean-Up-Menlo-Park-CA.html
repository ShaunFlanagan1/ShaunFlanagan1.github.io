Ulocladium: this mold needs extreme quantities of water to grow, so it is typically only found in homes that have gone through flooding. Many individuals are allergic to this kind of mold.<p>
<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were really happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to get the job done effectively. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
