<p>If smoke and fire damage has actually affected your possessions, we will deal with you and your insurance provider to identify what can be brought back, and what will be an insurance coverage replacement claim. For products that can be brought back, we use ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged personal belongings. For this, we used Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is act like a glue which penetrates into permeable surface area, preventing water from leaking back through. Essentially, it makes the location solid again and protects the surface area from future water damage. After you have actually applied the Peel-Stop, permit an hour of drying time.<p>
