<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were really delighted that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to get the job done properly.
