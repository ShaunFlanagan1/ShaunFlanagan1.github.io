<h3>Water Destruction in Huntington Indiana</h2>
<p>From leaking faucets to rupture pipelines and flooding, water damage is among the most typical and potentially destructive issues you can deal with as a homeowner.

When the worst occurs, call the experts at ServiceMaster Restore.

<p>Because mold and mildew can be a serious health risk, it's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove as much as 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product ought to be gotten rid of to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to change the damage with full sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material ought to be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>This area of the attic is among the most frequently affected spaces, which is why it's often treated individually. Leakages from the roofing will make this location damp, which in turn leads 2 to greater than average mold development. Cleaning the underside of the deck completely and using scrubbers to make sure the spores don't spread is the normal process here, and costs around $500.</p>
