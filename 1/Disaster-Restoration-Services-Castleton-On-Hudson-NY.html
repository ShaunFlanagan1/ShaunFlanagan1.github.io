<p>Thoroughly shake the spray bottle of mold-mitigating solution, then spray the affected location so it's well-saturated. (Continue to shake the bottle consistently during this procedure in order to make sure the solution stays well combined.) Allow the liquid to sit on the mold for 5 to 10 minutes so the anti-bacterial properties have time to work through the gunk. Never ever scrape dried mold, or else the hazardous spores could spread out into air and cause negative health impacts.</p>

<p>Recent Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were very happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
