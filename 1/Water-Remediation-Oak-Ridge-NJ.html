<h2>How To Prevent And Repair Water Damaged Brickwork in Oak Ridge?</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been shown ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we initially check for any security hazards, following OSHA and COIT rules for restricted area entry. We then extract standing water utilizing our truck-mounted extraction equipment. If your insulation has been impacted, we will remove the damaged insulation, bag it up, and securely get rid of it. If they have been damaged, we will also check vapor barriers (a sheet or covering that prevents water vapor from permeating walls) and eliminate them.</p>
