<p>Fire is the outcome of a chemical reaction in between the oxygen that exists in the atmosphere and a source of flammable fuel. As soon as this flammable fuel - carpet, drywall, or furnishings - has actually been warmed to its special ignition temperature level, the fuel will ignite and volatile gases will be released in the type of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can cause long lasting damage and should be handled by experienced professionals, heat is the most obvious, and harmful, product of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - suggesting that as a fire comes into contact with additional fuel, the response continues and the fire spreads.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we equip the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for each two to three spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it travels through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and accredited to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which suggests that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell got rid of. This procedure goes on for days. As you can picture, throughout a number of days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
