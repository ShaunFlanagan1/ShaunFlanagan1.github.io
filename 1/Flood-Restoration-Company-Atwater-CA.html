An automatic shut-off valve is outstanding insurance to have in any situation, specifically when the water heater unit is located inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your water heater is imminent unless fixed rapidly, and the expenses go up the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The offender might have been something as basic as a pressure relief valve needing replacing or something devastating like a tank failure.</p>

While smoke and the residue it leaves can trigger enduring damage and needs to be dealt with by experienced specialists, heat is the most obvious, and destructive, product of this chemical reaction.
