<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is in fact made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people believe that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve searching a large area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one jet stream. The rotor brings the wet desiccant to the reactivation air stream to heat it up. When moist inbound air flows over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant, desiccant dehumidifiers work. This process absorbs wetness without ice build-up and is not limited by low temperatures. Desiccants can quickly operate below freezing temperatures.</p>
