If there is a great deal of mold growth, speak with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's assistance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ". Printable versions of these and other guidance documents are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold web page If the moldy product is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement may be needed.<p>
