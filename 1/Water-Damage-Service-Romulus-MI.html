<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. An automated shut-off valve is excellent insurance to have in any circumstance, particularly when the hot water heater system lies inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your hot water heater impends unless fixed quickly, and the costs increase the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The culprit might have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve needing changing or something devastating like a tank failure.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, attempt to preserve the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter and less than 60 percent the rest of the year. You can buy devices to measure relative humidity at some home supply shops. Ventilation, air circulation near cold surface areas, dehumidification, and efforts to minimize the production of moisture in the home are all really crucial in controlling high humidity that often triggers mold development in our environment.</p>
