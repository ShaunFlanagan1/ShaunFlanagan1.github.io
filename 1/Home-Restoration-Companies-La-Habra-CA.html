<p>Any structure that has experienced water damage or issues with excess moisture is at danger of mold development. Wear a respirator or a facemask ranked for black mold spore protection, and cover arms, hands and legs to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to get rid of visible mold.

Next, use business black mold removal products, which can be found in many hardware or home repair shops, to disinfect the moldy areas, in addition to any surrounding areas. Make sure it will not discolor the product or surface if you use bleach. Place all sponges, equipment and other products utilized in cleaning in a sturdy trash can, and if possible, remove the bag through a close-by exit instead of the primary home, to prevent dispersing mold spores.</p>
