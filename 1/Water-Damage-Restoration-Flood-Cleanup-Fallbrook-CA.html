<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your house or company is one of the most disastrous things that can take place to a family or a person.

<p>Since typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
