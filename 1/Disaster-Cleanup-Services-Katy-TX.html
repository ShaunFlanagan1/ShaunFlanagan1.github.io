<p>You want to attend to bathroom flooding as quickly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and produces an ideal breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 steps get you on the roadway to flooded bathroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to lift and unsettle the dampened mold. Move the brush in mindful strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health issue. After scrubbing completely with the brush, wipe the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>Eliminate any wall hangings, like pictures, if an area has actually sustained water damage. Keep them in a safe, dry location until they can be returned to the walls.
