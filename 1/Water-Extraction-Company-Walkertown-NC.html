<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and carried away whatever else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to do the job correctly.
