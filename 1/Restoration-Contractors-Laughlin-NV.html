<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As mentioned, quick air movement across wet surface areas of assemblies or products is a vital component of successfully and efficiently drying the surface of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface differ from moving excess wetness within the products or assemblies. Quick air movement throughout the surface of material becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface wetness gives way to decreasing moisture content in low evaporation materials. The continuous and falling rates of drying materials need various requirements for changing conditions.</p>
