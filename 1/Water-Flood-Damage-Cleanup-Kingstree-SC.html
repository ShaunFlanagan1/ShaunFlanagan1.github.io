<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are excellent for drying in hard to reach areas-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are preferable when drying under carpet and cushioning. Much like axial fans, centrifugal fans move air across wet surface areas, vaporizing moisture into the air. With making use of warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, a sufficient variety of centrifugal fans are preferred.</p>
<p>When standing water is eliminated, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) remove the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any adjustments.</p>
