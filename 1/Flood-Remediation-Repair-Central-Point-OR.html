<h3>Smoke Damage Restoration Service in Central Point</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repairs. By decreasing the thickness here, it's simpler to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is necessary to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is ended up, this helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
