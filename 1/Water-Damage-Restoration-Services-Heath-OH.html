<p>If a pipe in your home has leaked for months and gone without repair work, mold can grow as an outcome, but it won't be covered by your property owners insurance coverage. Given that floods can likewise cause mold, any potential mold that grows as a result of a flood would be covered by flood insurance, if you have it. Must you send a claim for mold damage, this cause would be assessed and figured out by the flood insurance coverage adjuster.</p>
